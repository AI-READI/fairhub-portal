## Data Sources

### Cited by

### Views
The view count is sourced from internal analytics via the [Umami Analytics API](https://umami.aireadi.org/api/auth/login). This service tracks user engagement and page views across the platform.

### Access Approved
The access approval count comes directly from the internal database, which records and manages dataset access requests and their approval statuses.
