  "string": "## Overview of the study\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health.\n\n## Description of the dataset\n\nThis dataset is a subset of [v3.0.0 of the AI-READI dataset](https://doi.org/10.60775/fairhub.3) containing data from 100 participants, created on popular demand solely to help develop pipelines before downloading the full dataset. We refer to v3.0.0 of the AI-READI dataset for details about the structure, standards, related resources, and more.\n\nThe dataset contains 15,793 files and is around 179.68 GB in size.\n\nA detailed description of the dataset is available in the AI-READI documentation for v3.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Protocol\n\nThe protocol followed for collecting the data can be found in the AI-READI documentation for v3.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Dataset access/restrictions\n\nAccessing the dataset requires several steps, including:\n\n- Login in through a verified ID system\n- Agreeing to use the data only for type 2 diabetes related research.\n- Agreeing to the license terms which set certain restrictions and obligations for data usage (see `License` section below).\n\n## License\n\nThis work is licensed under a custom license specifically tailored to enable the reuse of the AI-READI dataset (and other clinical datasets) for commercial or research purposes while putting strong requirements around data usage, security, and secondary sharing to protect study participants, especially when data is reused for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) related applications. More details are available in the License file included in the dataset and also available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17555036.\n\n## How to cite\n\nThis dataset was created for pipeline development only and should not be used for conducting scientific investigations.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, suggestions, or feedback related to this dataset, please go to https://aireadi.org/contact.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe AI-READI project is supported by NIH grant [1OT2OD032644](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/1ADgncihCk6fdMRJdCnBjg/project-details/10471118) through the NIH Bridge2AI Common Fund program."
