    "briefSummary": "The study will collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4000 people across the US from diverse racial/ethnic groups who are either 1) healthy, or 2) belong in one of the three stages of diabetes severity (pre-diabetes/lifestyle controlled, oral medication and/or non-insulin-injectable medication controlled, or insulin dependent), forming a total of four groups of patients. Clinical data (social determinants of health surveys, continuous glucose monitoring data, biomarkers, genetic data, retinal imaging, cognitive testing, etc.) will be collected. The purpose of this project is data generation to allow future creation of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms aimed at defining disease trajectories and underlying genetic links in different racial/ethnic cohorts. A smaller subgroup of participants will be invited to come for a follow-up visit in year 4 of the project (longitudinal arm of the study). Data will be placed in an open-source repository and samples will be sent to the study sample repository and used for future research.",
    "detailedDescription": "The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration)."

Second, an additional portion of the blood and the urine sample are processed and stored at the collection site for batch shipment to the University of Washington Nutrition and Obesity Research Center for specialized lab tests.  Third, the remaining majority of the collected blood is processed into a variety of derivatives that are being used to establish a large repository of biospecimens at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to be used in research to further our understanding of diabetes, diabetic associated eye disease and other applications related to health and related diseases. These derivatives include isolated plasma, serum, DNA, buffy coats (white blood cells), blood stabilized for future isolation of RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). These derivatives are separated into small aliquots to facilitate future approved research test and are stored at either -80oC or at cryogenic temperatures (PBMC)."

    "readme": "## Overview of the study\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration).\n\n## Description of the dataset\n\nThis dataset contains data from 1067 participants that was collected between from July 19, 2023 and July 31, 2024. Data from multiple modalities are included. A full list is provided in the `Data Standards` section below. The data in this dataset contain no protected health information (PHI). Information related to the sex and race/ethnicity of the participants as well as medication used has also been removed.\n\nThe dataset contains 165,227 files and is around 1.83 TB in size.\n\nA detailed description of the dataset is available in the AI-READI documentation for v2.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Protocol\n\nThe protocol followed for collecting the data can be found in the AI-READI documentation for v2.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Dataset access/restrictions\n\nAccessing the dataset requires several steps, including:\n\n- Login in through a verified ID system\n- Agreeing to use the data only for type 2 diabetes related research.\n- Agreeing to the license terms which set certain restrictions and obligations for data usage (see `License` section below).\n\n## Data standards followed\n\nThis dataset is organized following the [Clinical Dataset Structure (CDS) v0.1.1](https://cds-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.1/). We refer to the CDS documentation for more details. Briefly, data is organized at the root level into one directory per datatype (c.f. Table below). Within each datatype folder, there is one folder per modality. Within each modality folder, there is one folder per device used to collect that modality. Within each device folder, there is one folder per participant. Each datatype, modality, and device folder is named using a name that best defines it. Each participant folder is named after the participant's ID number used in the study. For each datatype, the data files follow the standards listed in the Table below. More details are available in the dataset_structure_description.json metadata file included in this dataset.\n\n| Datatype directory name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      | File format standard followed                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| cardiac_ecg               | This directory contains electrocardiogram data collected by a 12 lead protocol (the current standard), Holter monitor, or smartwatch.

            "response": "The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) is a dataset consisting of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The composition of the dataset was designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind. This included recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across sex, race, and diabetes severity, as well as the design of a data acquisition protocol across multiple domains (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data. The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. Some data that are not considered to be sensitive personal health data will be available to the public for download upon agreement with a license that defines how the data can be used. The full dataset will be accessible by entering into a data use agreement. The public dataset will include survey data, blood and urine lab results, fitness activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g. monofilament and cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and home air quality. The data held under controlled access include 5-digit zip code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, medications, past health records, and traffic and accident reports. Of note, the overall enrollment goal is to have balanced distribution between different racial groups. As enrollment is ongoing, periodic updates to data releases may not have achieved balanced distribution across groups."

            "response": "The devices included in the study are as follows, and more details can be found at [https://docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org):\n\n   **Environmental sensor device**\n\n   Participants will be sent home with an environmental sensor (a custom-designed sensor unit called the LeeLab Anura), which they will use for 10 continuous days before returning the devices to the clinical research coordinators for data download.\n\n   **Continuous glucose monitor (Dexcom G6)**\n\n   The Dexcom G6 is a real-time, integrated continuous glucose monitoring system (iCGM) that directly monitors blood glucose levels without requiring finger sticks. It must be worn continuously in order to collect data.\n\n   **Wearable accelerometer (Physical activity monitor)**\n\n   The Garmin Vivosmart 5 Fitness Activity tracker will be used to measure data related to physical activity.\n\n   **Heart rate**\n\n   Heart rate can be read from EKG or blood pressure measurement devices.\n\n   **Blood pressure**\n\n   Blood pressure devices used for the study across the various data acquisition sites are: OMRON HEM 907XL Blood Pressure Monitor, Medline MDS4001 Automatic Digital Blood Pressure Monitor, and Welch Allyn 6000 series Vital signs monitor with Welch Allyn FlexiPort Reusable Blood Pressure Cuff.\n\n   **Visual acuity**\n\n   M&S Technologies EVA device to test visual acuity. The test is administered at a distance of 4 meters from a touch-screen monitor that is 12x20 inches. Participants will read letters from the screen. Photopic Conditions: No neutral density filters are used. A general occluder will be used for photopic testing. The participant wears their own prescription spectacles or trial frames. For Mesopic conditions, a neutral density (ND) filter will be used. The ND filter will either be a lens added to trial frames to reduce incoming light on the tested eye, OR a handheld occluder with a neutral density\n   filter (which we will designate as “ND-occluder) over the glasses will be used. The ND-occluder is different from a standard occluder and is used only for vision testing under mesopic conditions.\n\n   **Contrast sensitivity**\n\n   The MARS Letter Contrast Sensitivity test (Perceptrix) was conducted monocularly under both Photopic conditions (with a general occluder) and Mesopic conditions (using a Neutral Density occluder with a low luminance filter lens). The standardized order of MARS cards was as follows: Photopic OD, Photopic OS, Mesopic OD, and Mesopic OS. The background luminance of the charts fell within the range of 60 to 120 cd/m2, with an optimal level of 85 cd/m2. Illuminance was recommended to be between 189 to 377 lux, with an optimal level of 267 lux. While the designed viewing distance was 50 cm, it could vary between 40 to 59 cm. Patients were required to wear their appropriate near correction: reading glasses or trial frames with +2.00D lenses. All testing was carried out under undilated conditions. Patients were instructed to read the letter left to right across each line on the chart. Patients were encouraged to guess, even if they perceived the letters as too faint. Testing was terminated either when the patient made two consecutive errors or reached the end of the chart. The log contrast sensitivity (log CS) values were recorded by multiplying the number of errors prior to the final correct letter by 0.04 and subtracting the result from the log CS value at the final correct letter. If a patient reached the end of the chart without making two consecutive errors, the final correct letter was simply the last one correctly identified.\n\n   **Autorefraction**\n\n   KR 800 Auto Keratometer/Refractor.\n\n   **EKG**\n\n   Philips (manufacturer of Pagewriter TC30 Cardiograph)\n\n   **Lensometer**\n\n   Lensometer devices used at data acquisition sites across the study include: NIDEK LM-600P Auto Lensometer, Topcon-CL-200 computerized Lensometer, and Topcon-CL-300 computerized Lensometer\n\n   **Undilated fundus photography - Optomed Aurora**\n\n   The Optomed Aurora IQ is a handheld fundus camera that can take non-mydriatic images of the ocular fundus. It has a 50° field of view, 5 Mpix sensor, and high-contrast optical design. The camera is non-mydriatic, meaning it doesn't require the pupil to be dilated, so it can be used for detailed viewing of the retina. Images taken during the AI-READI visit, are undilated images taken in a dark room while a patient is sitting on a comfortable chair, laying back. As it becomes challenging to get a good view because of the patients not being dilated and the handheld nature of this imaging modality, the quality of the images vary from patient to patient and within the same patient.\n\n   **Dilated fundus photography - Eidon**\n\n   The iCare EIDON is a widefield TrueColor confocal fundus imaging system that can capture images up to 200°. It comes with multiple imaging modalities, including TrueColor, blue, red, Red-Free, and infrared confocal images. The system offers widefield, ultra-high-resolution imaging and the capability to image through cataract and media opacities. It operates without dilation (minimum pupil 2.5 mm) and provides the flexibility of both fully automated and fully manual modes. Additionally, the iCare EIDON features an all-in-one compact design, eliminating the need for an additional PC. AI READI images using EIDON include two main modalities: 1. Single Field Central IR/FAF 2. Smart Horizontal Mosaic. Imaging is done in fully automated mode in a dark room with the machine moving and positioning according to the patient's head aiming at optimizing the view and minimizing operator's involvement/operator induced noise.\n\n   **Spectralis HRA (Heidelberg Engineering)**\n\n   The Heidelberg Spectralis HRA+OCT is an ophthalmic imaging system that combines optical coherence tomography (OCT) with retinal angiography. It is a modular, upgradable platform that allows clinicians to configure it for their specific diagnostic workflow. It has the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) technology that not only offers documentation of clinical findings but also often highlights critical diagnostic details that are not visible on traditional clinical ophthalmoscopy. Since cSLO imaging minimizes the effects of light scatter, it can be used effectively even in patients with cataracts. For AI READI subjects, imaging is done in a dark room using the following modalities: ONH-RC, PPole-H, and OCTA of the macula. As the machine is operated by the imaging team and is not fully automated, quality issues may arise, which may lead to skipping this modality and missing data.\n\n   **Triton DRI OCT (Topcon Healthcare)**\n\n   The DRI OCT Triton is a device from Topcon Healthcare that combines swept-source OCT technology with multimodal fundus imaging. The DRI OCT Triton uses swept-source technology to visualize the deepest layers of the eye, including through cataracts. It also enhances visualization of outer retinal structures and deep pathologies. The DRI OCT Triton has a 1,050 nm wavelength light source and a non-mydriatic color fundus camera. AI READI imaging is done in a dark room with minimal intervention from the imager as the machine positioning is done automatically. This leads to higher quality images with minimal operator induced error. Imaging is done in 12.0X12.0 mm and 6.0X6.0 mm OCTA, and 12.0 mm X9.0 mmX6.0 mm 3D Horizontal and Radial scan modes.\n\n   **Maestro2 3D OCT (Topcon Healthcare)**\n\n   The Maestro2 is a robotic OCT and color fundus camera system from Topcon Healthcare. It can capture a 12 mm x 9 mm wide-field OCT scan that includes the macula and optic disc. The Maestro2 can also capture high-resolution non-mydriatic, true color fundus photography, OCT, and OCTA with a single button press. Imaging is done in a dark room and automatically with minimal involvement of the operator. Protocols include 12.0 mm X9.0 mm widefield, 6.0 mm X 6.0 mm 3D macula scan and 6.0 mm X 6.0 mm OCTA (scan rate: 50 kHz).\n\n   **FLIO (Heidelberg Engineering)**\n\n   Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) is an advanced imaging technique used in ophthalmology. It is a non-invasive method that provides valuable information about the metabolic and functional status of the retina. FLIO is based on the measurement of fluorescence lifetimes, which is the duration a fluorophore remains in its excited state before emitting a photon and returning to the ground state. FLIO utilizes this fluorescence lifetime information to capture and analyze the metabolic processes occurring in the retina. Different retinal structures and molecules exhibit distinct fluorescence lifetimes, allowing for the visualization of metabolic changes, cellular activity, and the identification of specific biomolecules. The imaging is done by an operator in a dark room analogous to a straightforward heidelberg spectralis OCT. However, as it takes longer than a usual spectralis OCT and exposes patients to uncomfortable levels of light, it is kept to be performed as the last modality of an AI READI visit. Because of this patients may not be at their best possible compliance.\n\n   **Cirrus 5000 Angioplex (Carl Zeiss Meditec)**\n\n   The Zeiss Cirrus 5000 Angioplex is a high-definition optical coherence tomography (OCT) system that offers non-invasive imaging of retinal microvasculature. The imaging is done in a dark room by an operator and it is pretty straightforward and analogous to what is done in the ophthalmology clinics on a day to day basis. Imaging protocols include 512 X 512 and 200 X 200 macula and ONH scans and also OCTA of the macula. Zeiss Cirrus 5000 also provides a 60-degree OCTA widefield view. 8x8mm single scans and 14x14mm automated OCTA montage allow for rapid peripheral assessment of the retina as well.\n\n   **Monofilament testing for peripheral neuropathy**\n\n   Monofilament test is a standard clinical test to monitor peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. It is done using a standard 10g monofilament applying pressure to different points on the plantar surface of the feet. If patients sense the monofilament, they confirm by saying “yes”; if patients do not sense the monofilament after it bends, they are considered to be insensate. When the sequence is completed, the insensate area is retested for confirmation. This sequence is further repeated randomly at each of the testing sites on each foot until results are obtained.The results are recorded on an iPad, Laptop, or a paper questionnaire and are directly added to the project's RedCap by the clinical research staff.\n\n   **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)**\n\n   The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a simple, in-office screening tool that helps detect mild cognitive impairment and early onset of dementia. The MoCA evaluates cognitive domains such as: Memory, Executive functioning, Attention, Language, Visuospatial, Orientation, Visuoconstructional skills, Conceptual thinking, Calculations. The MoCA generates a total score and six domain-specific index scores. The maximum score is 30, and anything below 24 is a sign of cognitive impairment. A final total score of 26 and above is considered normal. Some disadvantages of the MoCA include: Professionals require training to score the test, A person's level of education may affect the test, Socioeconomic factors may affect the test, People living with depression or other mental health issues may score similarly to those with mild dementia. AI READI research staff perform this test on an iPad using a pre-installed software (MoCA Duo app downloaded from the app store) that captures all the patients responses in an interactive manner."

The sites were chosen for geographic diversity across the United States and to ensure diverse representation across various racial and ethnic groups. Individuals from all demographic backgrounds were recruited at all 3 sites.\n\n   Factors influencing the generalization of derived models include the predominantly urban and hospital-based recruitment, which may not fully capture diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. The study cohort may not provide a comprehensive representation of the population, as it does not include other races/ethnicities such as Pacific Islanders and Native Americans.\n\n   Information on device make and model, including specific modalities like macula scans or wide scans during OCT, were documented to ensure repeatability. Moreover, the study included multiple devices for one measure to enhance generalizability and represent the diverse range of equipment utilized in clinical settings."

For example, clinical data outside of expected min/max ranges were flagged in REDCap, which was visible in reports viewed by clinical research coordinators (CRCs) and Data Managers. Using these REDCap reports as guides, Data Managers and CRCs examined participant records and determined if an error was likely. Data were checked for the following and edited if errors were detected:\n\n   1. Credibility, based on range checks to determine if all responses fall within a prespecified reasonable range\n\n   2. Incorrect flow through prescribed skip patterns\n\n   3. Missing data that can be directly filed from other portions of an individual's record\n\n   4. The omission and/or duplication of records\n\n   Editing was only done under the guidance and approval of the site PI. If corrected data was available from elsewhere in the respondent's answers, the error was corrected. If there was no logical or appropriate way to correct the data, the Data site PI reviewed the values and made decisions about whether those values should be removed from the data.\n\n   Once data were sent from each of the study sites to the central project team, additional processing steps were conducted in preparation for dissemination. For example, all data were mapped to standardized terminologies when possible, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model, a common data model for observational health data, and the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), a commonly used standard for medical imaging data.
