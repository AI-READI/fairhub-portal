        "briefSummary": "The study will collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4000 people across the US from diverse racial/ethnic groups who are either 1) healthy, or 2) belong in one of the three stages of diabetes severity (pre-diabetes/lifestyle controlled, oral medication and/or non-insulin-injectable medication controlled, or insulin dependent), forming a total of four groups of patients. Clinical data (social determinants of health surveys, continuous glucose monitoring data, biomarkers, genetic data, retinal imaging, cognitive testing, etc.) will be collected. The purpose of this project is data generation to allow future creation of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms aimed at defining disease trajectories and underlying genetic links in different racial/ethnic cohorts. A smaller subgroup of participants will be invited to come for a follow-up visit in year 4 of the project (longitudinal arm of the study). Data will be placed in an open-source repository and samples will be sent to the study sample repository and used for future research.",
        "detailedDescription": "The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset. Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration)."

Second, an addition portion of the blood and the urine sample are processed and stored at the collection site for batch shipment to the University of Washington Nutrition and Obesity Research Center for specialized lab tests.  Third, the remaining majority of the collected blood is processed into a variety of derivatives that are being used to establish a large repository of biospecimens at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to be used in research to further our understanding of diabetes, diabetic associated eye disease and other applications related to health and related diseases. These derivatives include isolated plasma, serum, DNA, buffy coats (white blood cells), blood stabilized for future isolation of RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  These derivatives are separated into small aliquots to facilitate future approved research test and are stored at either -80oC or at cryogenic temperatures (PBMC)."

    "readme": "## Overview of the study\nThe Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset. Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration).\n\n## Description of the dataset\nThis dataset contain data from 204 participants from the pilot period of the project (July 19, 2023 to November 30, 2023). Data from multiple modalities are included. A full list is provided in the \"Data Standards\" section below. The data in this dataset contain no personel health information (PHI). Information related to the sex and race/ethnicity of the participants has also been removed.\n\nThe dataset contains 21,939 files and is around 310 GB in size.\n\nA detailed description of the dataset is available in the AI-READI documentation for v1.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Protocol\nThe protocol followed for collecting the data can be found in the AI-READI documentation for v1.0.0 of the dataset at [docs.aireadi.org](https://docs.aireadi.org/).\n\n## Dataset access/restrictions\nAccessing the dataset requires several steps, including:\n1. Login in through a verified ID system (such as Microsoft Entra Verified ID or Login.gov)\n2. Agreeing to use the data only for type 2 diabetes related research.\n3. Agreeing to the license terms which set certain restrictions and obligations for data usage (see \"License\" section below). \n\n## Data standards followed\nThis dataset is organized following the [Clinical Dataset Structure (CDS) v0.1.0](https://cds-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0/). We refer to the CDS documentation for more details. Briefly, data is organized at the root level into one directory per datatype (c.f. Table below). Within each datatype folder, there is one folder per modality. Within each modality folder, there is one folder per device used to collect that modality. Within each device folder, there is one folder per participant. Each datatype, modality, and device folder is named using a name that best defines. Each participant folder is named after the participant's ID number used in the study. For each datatype, the data files follow the standards listed in the Table below. More details are available in the dataset_structure_description.json metadata file included in this dataset. An mock of the dataset structure is available [here](https://github.com/AI-READI/ai-readi-dataset-mock).\n\n| Datatype directory name | Description | File format standard followed |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- \n| cardiac_ecg      | This directory contains electrocardiogram data collected by a 12 lead protocol (the current standard), Holter monitor, or smartwatch.

The composition of the dataset was designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind. This included recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across sex, race, and diabetes severity, as well as the design of a data acquisition protocol across multiple domains (survey data, phyftrainsical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data. The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. Some data that are not considered to be sensitive personal health data will be available to the public for download upon agreement with a license that defines how the data can be used. The full dataset will be accessible by entering into a data use agreement. The public dataset will include survey data, blood and urine lab results, fitness activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g. monofilament and cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and home air quality. The data held under controlled access include 5-digit zip code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, medications, past health records, and traffic and accident reports. Of note, the overall enrollment goal is to have balanced distribution between different racial groups. As enrollment is ongoing, the pilot data release and periodic updates to data releases may not have achieved balanced  distribution across groups. \n\n"

T2DM is a growing public health threat. Yet, the current understanding of T2DM, especially in the context of salutogenesis, is limited. Given the complexity of T2DM, AI-based approaches may help with improving our understanding but a key issue is the lack of data ready for training AI models. The AI-READI dataset is intended to fill this gap."

The sites were chosen for geographic diversity across the United States and to ensure diverse representation across various racial and ethnic groups. Individuals from all demographic backgrounds were recruited at all 3 sites. Factors influencing the generalization of derived models include the predominantly urban and hospital-based recruitment, which may not fully capture diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. The study cohort may not provide a comprehensive representation of the population, as it does not include other races/ethnicities such as Pacific Islanders and Native Americans. Information on device make and model, including specific modalities like macula scans or wide scans during OCT, were documented to ensure repeatability.
