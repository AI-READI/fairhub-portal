        "DetailedDescription": "The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset. Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration)."

    "readme": "## Overview of the study\n  The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine a light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health. Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions are working together to develop this flagship dataset. The project will aim to collect data from 4,000 participants across three sites: the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and the University of Washington (UW). To ensure the data is population-representative, the 4,000 participants will be balanced for three factors: disease severity, ethnicity, and sex. More information about the study can be found on the study website at [aireadi.org](https://aireadi.org). \n  \n  ## Description of the dataset\n  This dataset contain data from 4 participants from the pilot study of the project.

Most of these questions are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.*\n  \n  1. **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g. documents, photos, people, countries)?** Are there multiple types of instances (e.g. movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.\n  \n        Instances are images of people from the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset.\n  \n  2. **How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?**\n  \n        13,233 images of 5,749 people.\n  \n  3. **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g. geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g. to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\n  \n        The dataset is a sample of the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset. The sample was chosen to provide a diverse range of people.\n  \n  4. **What data does each instance consist of?** \"Raw\" data (e.g. unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.\n  \n        Each instance is a 250x250 pixel image of a person's face.\n  \n  5. **Is there a label or target associated with each instance?** If so, please provide a description.\n  \n        Each instance is labeled with the ID of the person in the image.\n  \n  6. **Is any information missing from individual instances?** If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g. because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g. redacted text.\n  \n        No.\n  \n  7. **Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g. users' movie ratings, social network links)?** If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.\n  \n        No.\n  \n  8. **Are there recommended data splits (e.g. training, development/validation, testing)?** If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.\n  \n        No.\n  \n  9. **Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** If so, please provide a description.\n  \n        No.\n  \n  10. **Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g. websites, tweets, other datasets)?** If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g. licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.\n  \n        Yes, the dataset is self-contained.\n  \n  11. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)?** If so, please provide a description.\n  \n        No. All sensitive data has been removed.\n  \n  12. **Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?** If so, please describe why.\n  \n        No.\n  \n  13. **Does the dataset relate to people?** If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.\n  \n        Yes, the dataset contains images of people. However, all sensitive data has been removed.\n  \n  14. **Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g. by age, gender)?** If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.\n  \n        Yes, categories were made to identify subpopulations based on age and location.\n  \n  15. **Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?** If so, please describe how.\n  \n        No, all sensitive data has been removed.\n  \n  16. **Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g. data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?** If so, please provide a description.\n  \n        No, all sensitive data has been removed.\n  \n  17. **Any other comments?**\n  \n        N/A\n  \n  \n  ## Collection\n  \n  *As with the previous section, dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any data collection to flag potential issues and then provide answers once collection is complete. In addition to the goals of the prior section, the answers to questions here may provide information that allow others to reconstruct the dataset without access to it.*\n  \n  1. **How was the data associated with each instance acquired?** Was the data directly observable (e.g. raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g. survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g. part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.\n  \n        The data was acquired from the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset. The dataset was validated by removing all sensitive data.\n  \n  2. **What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g. hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?** How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  3. **If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g. deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?**\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  4. **Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g. students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g. how much were crowdworkers paid)?**\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  5. **Over what timeframe was the data collected?** Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g. recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created. Finally, list when the dataset was first published.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  7. **Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g. by an institutional review board)?** If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  8. **Does the dataset relate to people?** If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  9. **Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g. websites)?**\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  10. **Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection?** If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  11. **Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?** If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  12. **If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?** If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  13. **Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g. a data protection impact analysis) been conducted?** If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  14. **Any other comments?**\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  \n  ## Preprocessing / Cleaning / Labeling\n  \n  *Dataset creators should read through these questions prior to any pre-processing, cleaning, or labeling and then provide answers once these tasks are complete. The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks. For example, text that has been converted into a “bag-of-words” is not suitable for tasks involving word order.*\n  \n  1. **Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g. discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?** If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  2. **Was the \"raw\" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g. to support unanticipated future uses)?** If so, please provide a link or other access point to the \"raw\" data.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  3. **Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?** If so, please provide a link or other access point.\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  4. **Any other comments?**\n  \n        *Your Answer Here*\n  \n  \n  ## Uses\n  \n  *These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to reflect on the tasks  for  which  the  dataset  should  and  should  not  be  used.
