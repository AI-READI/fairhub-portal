        "detailedDescription": "The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender, and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions will work together to develop this flagship dataset. Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation, analysis, and sharing and collaboration)."

    "readme": "## Overview of the study\n  The AI-READI project seeks to create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes. The data will be optimized for future artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) analysis that could provide critical insights and especially shine a light on the salutogenic pathways from diabetes to return to health. Six cross-disciplinary project modules involving teams located across eight institutions are working together to develop this flagship dataset. The project will aim to collect data from 4,000 participants across three sites: the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and the University of Washington (UW). To ensure the data is population-representative, the 4,000 participants will be balanced for three factors: disease severity, ethnicity, and sex. More information about the study can be found on the study website at [aireadi.org](https://aireadi.org). \n  \n  ## Description of the dataset\n  This dataset contain data from 4 participants from the pilot study of the project.
