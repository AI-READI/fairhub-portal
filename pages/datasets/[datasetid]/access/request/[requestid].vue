                  is a Microsoft-developed command line program designed to
                  interact with Azure Cloud Storage. For this method you will
                  need to download a dataset-specific Shared Access Signature

                  Below is a brief summary of steps you'll need to accomplish
                  your download:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Visit the Azcopy documentation page and
                    <NuxtLink
                      to="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#download-azcopy"

                    >
                      download
                    </NuxtLink>
                    the compressed azcopy executable for your respective
                    operating system. These executables are available as
                    compressed zip files for Windows/Mac users and Tarball files
                    for Linux users.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Extract the contents of the compressed executable in a known
                    location on your local machine's drive. - Windows and Mac
                    users can use built-in zip file applications or use
                    3rd-party applications like 7zip for this - For linux users,
                    please see documentation for your specific distro for
                    instructions on decompressing the provided tarball -
                    Possible locations for this are: in your home directory; in
                    your machine's C:/ or Root directory - For ease of use,
                    consider adding the fully-qualified path to the AzCopy
                    directory to your system PATH. If you choose not to do this
                    you will need to execute any AzCopy commands from the
                    directory where AzCopy is installed.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Open a terminal or powershell instance and execute the
                    following:
                    <n-code
                      :code="azcopyCommand"
                      language="powershell"
                      @click="copyToClipboard(azcopyCommand)"
                    />

                    Where the https URL is the SAS URI you obtained from the
                    portal and "C:\local\path" is the local path on your target
                    machine.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Please allow time for the download to complete. Depending on
                    the amount of data you selected, this could take several
                    hours.

                  solutions, including AWS S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud
                  Storage and more. For this method you will need to download a
                  dataset-specific Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI.

                    as a single executable. Download the executable specific to
                    operating system and follow the [installation instructions]
                    to install rclone.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Next you'll need to configure your connection to the Fairhub
                    Portal Azure Blob Storage. Open your terminal or command
                    line program of choice and run:
                    <n-code code="rclone config" language="powershell" />
                    then follow the
                    <NuxtLink
                      to="https://rclone.org/azureblob/#configuration"

                    </NuxtLink>
                    . For authentication you will be using the
                    <NuxtLink
                      to="https://rclone.org/azureblob/#sas-url"

                    >
                      Shared Access Signature URL
                    </NuxtLink>
                    that you just obtained above; be sure to leave the `account`
                    and `key` configuration options blank and fill in the
                    `sas_url` Remember the name you give to the Azure Blob
                    Storage configuration, as you will need it in subsequent
                    steps.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Once Azure Blob Storage configuration is complete, you can
                    either use it for download to your local user system or you
                    can configure an additional connection to any other cloud
                    storage provider. For example, to configure a connection to
                    AWS S3 or a cloud storage provider that is compatible with
                    AWS S3 Backend, follow

                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Once your configuration is complete, you can download your
                    requested materials by issuing the following command:

                    />
                    Or, for transfer to other cloud storage providers:
                    <n-code
                      code="rclone copy example-azure-config-name:blob-container-name example-destination-provider-config-name:path/to/directory"

                    />
                  </li>

                  <li>
