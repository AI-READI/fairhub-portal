AI-READI DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT (Version 2.0)

BY INDICATING ASSENT, THE LICENSEE IDENTIFIED IN THE DATA REQUEST WORKFLOW
(“LICENSEE” OR “YOU”), AGREES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS DATA
LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH LICENSOR (“AGREEMENT”) WITH RESPECT TO THE
CONTENTS OF THE ACCOMPANYING DATA FILES (COLLECTIVELY, THE "DATA"). THE
INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED IN THE DATA REQUEST WORKFLOW
CONSTITUTES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

YOU SHOULD SAVE OR PRINT A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT
DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE DATA.

1. PARTIES; AUTHORIZED USERS.

    A. If, in Your Data Request Workflow, You indicated that you are entering into this Agreement
    in your individual capacity, then You are the “Licensee” and no other person will be
    authorized to access or use the Data under this Agreement. If you wish to share Data with
    members of your internal group or team or other employees or contractors of your
    employer, please initiate a new Data Request Workflow and indicate this information when
    requested, upon which a new license agreement will be generated and provided for your
    acceptance. References to “Authorized Group” and “Authorized Users” in this Agreement,
    and the provisions of Paragraphs 1.B through 1.E below, do not apply to You.

    B. If, in Your Data Request Workflow, You indicated that you are entering into this Agreement
    on behalf of an internal group, lab, or business unit identified in the Data Request
    Workflow (“Authorized Group”) that is a part of the Institution/Employer specified in your
    Data Request Workflow (“Institution/Employer”), then this Agreement authorizes access,
    downloading and use of the Data by You, as Licensee, as well as Authorized Users, on the
    terms set forth below.

    C. “Authorized Users” means individuals who are legal members of the Authorized Group via
    contract, employment status or student status. The Authorized Group must be an officially
    recognized subunit within the Institution/Employer identified in the Data Request
    Workflow, as evidenced by a public web page or other official and publicly available
    Institution/Employer information source. An individual’s status as an Authorized User, and
    their rights under this Agreement, terminate automatically upon the severance of their
    relationship or employment with the Authorized Group or Institution/Employer.

    D. You, as Licensee, are permitted to sublicense your rights to Authorized Users for so long
    as they are members of the Authorized Group. Authorized Users are entitled to exercise
    all rights granted to you as Licensee under this Agreement. It is your responsibility to
    ensure that each Authorized User is provided with a copy of this Agreement and
    understands and agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

    E. You must ensure that each Authorized User complies fully with the terms of this
    Agreement and you agree that you will be fully liable for all acts and omissions of each
    Authorized User. You represent and warrant to Licensor that you have all necessary legal
    rights and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of all Authorized Users.

2. LICENSE GRANT. Subject to Licensee’s and all Authorized Users’ compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive and
non-transferable license to download, reproduce and use the Data, and to create derivative works
of the Data, for research, commercial and non-commercial purposes. All full and partial copies of
the Data made by Licensee shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

3. LIMITATIONS ON DATA SHARING; STORAGE; AND USAGE.

    A. Permitted Sharing with Other Licensees. Licensee shall not transfer, license,
    sublicense, sell, assign, display, share or otherwise convey any portion of the Data or any
    derivative work to any third party other than another licensee (“Other Licensee”) that is
    bound by the terms of an agreement with Licensor on terms identical to those contained in
    this Agreement, in which case Licensee shall be permitted to give access to the Data to
    such Other Licensee and its employees, agents and contractors that are bound under
    such agreement for the purpose of collaborating with Licensee on one or more projects
    involving the Data.

    B. Permitted Data Storage. Licensee may use and store the data only on (i) servers
    and devices maintained by and located within Licensee’s Institution/Employer, or (ii) on
    cloud or remote storage and backup services (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS,
    Microsoft Azure) that have a HIPAA-approved Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) in
    place with Licensee’s Institution/Employer.

    C. Interaction with Third Party Models. Licensee shall not share or distribute Data with
    any third party model vendor or developer for training or development purposes, even if
    that vendor is a party to a BAA with Licensee’s Institution/Employer, where training
    includes model weight modification and other adjustments to a model’s logic or operation.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may use a third party model to analyze the
    Data if the model vendor is a party to a BAA with Licensee’s Institution/Employer, where
    the model’s interaction with the Data is limited to short-term interaction (e.g., prompting or
    querying), but is not used for training purposes.

    D. Licensee Models. Licensee is permitted to make, reproduce and distribute models,
    algorithms and programs that are developed, trained or adapted using the Data, but which
    do not themselves contain the Data or any modified version of the Data (“Licensee
    Models”), provided that Licensee, prior to dissemination of any such Licensee Models,
    undertakes all reasonable efforts to minimise the likelihood that Data can be memorized,
    derived, reconstructed or reconstituted through the use or construction of such Licensee
    Models.

    E. Derivative Data. “Derivative data” is Data that has been modified, excerpted,
    encrypted, condensed, encoded, translated or otherwise altered, such that it contains
    Data or Data may be derived from it. “Synthetic Data” is artificially generated data that
    mimics real-world data characteristics. Synthetic Data that is created using Data or
    Derivative Data is also considered Derivative Data. For purposes of this Agreement,
    Derivative Data is considered to be Data subject to all restrictions described herein.

    F. Publications. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Data may not be
    reproduced in papers, articles, presentations, analyses, reports or publications (“Papers”)
    except that small representative samples of Data may be reproduced in up to five images
    or figures per Paper for illustrative purposes only. Notwithstanding journal or conference
    requirements, larger amounts of data shall not be published, posted or otherwise made
    available via supplemental files, zip archives, code packages or other means. Licensee
    may refer publishers and conference organizers to Licensor if they wish to obtain a
    separate license to the Data for such purposes.

4. ADDITIONAL USE RESTRICTIONS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Licensee shall not:

    A. Make clinical treatment decisions based on the Data, as it is intended solely as a
    research resource, or

    B. Use or attempt to use the Data, alone or in concert with other information, (i) to
    compromise or otherwise infringe the confidentiality of information about an individual
    person who is the source of any Data or any clinical data or biological sample from which
    Data has been generated (a “Data Subject”), (ii) to invade or compromise the privacy of
    any Data Subject, (iii) to attempt to identify or contact any Data Subject or group of Data
    Subjects,(iv) to extract or extrapolate any identifying information about a Data Subject, to
    establish a Data Subject's membership in a particular group of persons, or otherwise to
    cause harm or injury to any Data Subject.

5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Licensee agrees to acknowledge Licensor and the source and
any funder of the Data in any Papers reporting use of the Data. The current citation can be found
here: docs.aireadi.org.

6. SECURITY. Licensee agrees to comply with all data security and privacy standards
established by the U.S. National Institutes of Health under its Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy
from time to time, the current version of which is located at NIH Security Best Practices for
Controlled-Access Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy
(https://sharing.nih.gov/sites/default/files/flmngr/NIH_Best_Practices_for_ControlledAccess_Data_Subject_to_the_NIH_GDS_Policy.pdf). Licensee acknowledges that the Data may be
statically watermarked to identify Licensee for security purposes, and Licensee agrees that it will
take no action to remove, obscure, alter or mask such watermarking.

7. TERMINATION. This Agreement will terminate automatically upon any breach of any term
of this Agreement by Licensee or any Authorized User. Upon termination, Licensee shall delete all
copies of the Data in its possession and control, including in the possession or control of all
Authorized Users, and cease all use of the Data.

8. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. Title to the Data, and all industrial and intellectual property rights
therein, shall at all times remain solely and exclusively with Licensor and its suppliers, and Licensee
shall not take any action inconsistent with such ownership. Any rights not expressly granted herein
are reserved to Licensor and its suppliers.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES
THAT IT IS FREE FROM DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
DATA IS BORNE BY LICENSEE. SHOULD THE DATA PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
LICENSEE AND NOT LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS ASSUMES THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY
SERVICE AND REPAIR. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF THE DATA IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

10. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY
AUTHORIZED USER OR OTHER PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH LICENSEE FOR ANY
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, MULTIPLE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE DATA, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, AND
REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

IN ANY CASE, LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE
ONE U.S. DOLLAR, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY
THE NEGLIGENCE OF LICENSOR TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE
LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE.

11. INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent allowed by applicable law, Licensee agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Licensor and its suppliers and their respective employees, officers,
directors, contractors and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
settlements, penalties, costs, expenses and other amounts arising directly or indirectly from
Licensee’s or any Authorized Users use of the Data and any use, distribution or activity of a Model,
including, without limitation, all third party claims asserting violation of privacy rights, death,
personal harm or injury, economic loss, emotional distress, discrimination, defamation, breach of
security, national security, or infringement of patent, copyright or other intellectual or industrial
property rights.

12. COMPLIANCE. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
restrictions relating to the distribution and use of the Data and Models.

13. GENERAL. (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
concerning the subject matter hereof. (b) Subject to the Licensor’s right to update and modify its
security policies as provided in Paragraph 6, this Agreement may be amended only by a writing
signed by both parties. (c) If any provision in this Agreement should be held illegal or unenforceable
by a court having jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it
enforceable without losing its intent, or severed from this Agreement if no such modification is
possible, and other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. (d) The
language of this Agreement is English. (e) A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this
Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall not waive such term or condition or
any subsequent breach thereof. (f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.`);
